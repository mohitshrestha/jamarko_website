    "text": "Our Story\nGrowing up in a clean and green Nepal, the issue of unmanaged waste especially paper waste in Kathmandu valley concerned Aruna and Muna, the founders of Jamarko, a lot. Paper constitutes around 9% of total household waste in Kathmandu. Realizing the prospect of reusing and recycling paper, they decided to start a paper recycling company. Both sisters attended various workshops and training to learn the methods of paper recycling, and craft them into functional and innovative products. Since then Jamarko has been in the forefront of paper recycling in Kathmandu.\nJamarko is the only recycled paper factory in Kathmandu that has been tirelessly working since the past 15 years. The market is tough given the political instability in Nepal, however, Jamarko is undaunted by the circumstances and remains to continue its effort to recycling awareness and local product promotion."

At Jamarko, we collect waste paper from various places which are sorted out, shredded into small pieces, and soaked overnight. The soaked paper pieces are then mixed to form a gooey pulp, which then is strained, and dried into sheets of paper in the sun. By recycling paper, we are making an effort to conserve the limited natural resources and the habitat of countless other beings.\nWe promote the use of recycled paper and products to help people become a part of the solution - meeting their commitment to environment as our products made from 100% recycled paper helps conserve our environment, especially our green forests.\n\n\n\nJamarko paper products made from 100% recycled paper\n\n\nLokta paper is a traditional handmade Nepali paper made from Lokta fiber, native bast fiber renowned for its strength and durability. Lokta, botanically known as Daphne Bhoula or Daphne Papyracea is found at the altitude of 6500 feet to 9500 feet from the sea level, is an indigenous plant of Nepal. The Lokta shrub is actually strengthened by harvesting the crops. If left to grow on its own, the plant would eventually dry up. Lokta plant is harvested by cutting its stem at ground level ensuring its main roots are not destroyed, thus conserving the forest ecology.\n\n\n\nJamarko paper products made from Lokta paper"
