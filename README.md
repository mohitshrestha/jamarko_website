Jamarko was established in 2001 as a small cottage industry with the view of contributing towards environmental conservation and to provide employment to the underprivileged, especially women.

While Jamarko’s short-term objective is to minimize the amount of waste paper, the long-term goal is to help conserve natural resources and habitats, and promote local handmade products. Through its activities and campaigns, Jamarko helps create awareness about the importance of reducing consumption and waste, provides handmade recycled paper and products as an alternative to consumers.

Jamarko recycles waste paper and produces recycled paper and product. At Jamarko, we collect paper waste from various sources, and recycle them to produce recycled paper products. Jamarko also uses Nepali Lokta Paper to create various paper products. Lokta paper is a traditional handmade Nepali paper made from Lokta fiber, a native bast fiber renown for its strength and durability.

We believe there is a high potential for the use of recycled paper and products in our communities. But most importantly, paper recycling, today, has become a necessity to conserve the limited natural resources and the habitat of countless other beings.
